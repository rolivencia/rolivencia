# Greetings fellow developer! This is Ramiro 👋

At my GitHub repositories you will find some personal projects that I develop in my free time outside of my main job position. Feel free to take a look, to ask questions and to send PRs if you wish to do so. Some of my projects are still private and are waiting for proper documentation to be released as open source.

## About Me:
😄 Pronouns: he/him.

💻 Currently working as a Senior Frontend Engineer at [Latch](https://www.latch.com/).

🛠️ I specialize in Angular and TypeScript as my current core technologies. I'm also a devoted agilist and a [Certified Scrum Master](https://github.com/rolivencia/rolivencia/blob/main/csm-certificate.pdf). Kanban, Scrum and Essence are the main software development frameworks I've worked with.

🌱I’m currently learning about the [Sanity](https://sanity.io) content platform and the [NX](https://nx.dev/) monorepo toolkit, together with [AnalogJS](https://analogjs.org/) — which I'm currently using to develop my personal website.

📚 I obtained a BD in Information Systems Analysis from the Universidad Tecnológica Nacional. I'm currently finishing my ED in Information Systems Engineering. I have 10+ years of experience in the IT industry.
